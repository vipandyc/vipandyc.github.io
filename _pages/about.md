Hi! I'm Mouyang Cheng (程谋阳), 1st year graduate student in MIT CSE-DMSE (Computational Science and Engineering @ Department of Material Science and Engineering) program. I got my bachelor's degree in Peking University, China, majoring in physics, where I conducted my undergraduate research in Prof. Ji Chen's group. For the PhD career I'm now doing research at Prof. Mingda Li's group. My research interest covers a wide range of topics in computational material science, closely bonded to understanding actual experiments.
