Hi! I'm Mouyang Cheng (ç¨‹è°‹é˜³), 1st year graduate student in MIT CSE-DMSE (Computational Science and Engineering @ Department of Material Science and Engineering) program. I got my bachelor's degree in Peking University, China, majoring in physics, where I conducted my undergraduate research in Prof. Ji Chen's group. For the PhD career I'm now doing research at Prof. Mingda Li's group. My research interest covers a wide range of topics in computational material science, closely bonded to understanding actual experiments.

Specifically, my current interest includes understanding defects and amorphous systems using computational methods, and predicting experimental synthesis recipe using advanced machine learning techniques. I'm also generally interested in predicting novel properties of energy materials, and inverse designing next-generation advanced functional materials.

There will be future updates on this personal page!
